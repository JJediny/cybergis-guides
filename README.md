## Description

This repo includes guides for managing a CyberGIS infrastructure and executing standard tasks.  There are currently three guides: (1) Vanilla GeoNode, (2) ROGUE GeoNode, and (3) OpenGeo Suite.  These guides were made to simplify deployment of CyberGIS components in a production environment.

If you are just interested in a basic deployment of GeoNode on Ubuntu 12.04, you can use the installation instructions found at [http://geonode.org/](http://geonode.org/).

If you are intersted in a basic deployment of the OpenGeo Suite on Ubuntu 12.04, you can use the installation instructions found at [http://suite.opengeo.org/opengeo-docs/installation/ubuntu/install.html](http://suite.opengeo.org/opengeo-docs/installation/ubuntu/install.html).

### CyberGIS
The Humanitarian Information Unit has been developing a sophisticated geographic computing infrastructure referred to as the CyberGIS. The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects.  The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, GeoGit, OGR, and OpenLayers.  The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.

### ROGUE
The Rapid Opensource Geospatial User-Driven Enterprise (ROGUE) Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) is a two-year research & development project developing the technology for distributed geographic data creation and synchronization in a disconnected environement.  This new technology taken altogether is referred to as GeoSHAPE.  See [http://geoshape.org](http://geoshape.org) for more information.  HIU is leveraging the technology developed through ROGUE to build out the CyberGIS into a robust globally distributed infrastruture.

## Usage

Use these guides to learn how to launch and manage a CyberGIS infrastructure and execute standard tasks.
